# The Goober Pack (placeholder name)

Gooberpack is a NeoForge 1.21.1 modpack focusing largely on Modern Industrialization, AE2, and EnderIO.

There's also some extra mods I added mostly because they seemed wacky and fairly niche. (Spelled, Saturated)

The pack is _currently_ in very early alpha and as such doesn't have any release zips on the github. Might set up a github action to do that later.
